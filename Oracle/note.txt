1.Create a PSQL block thet accepts two numerical values from
the user and display their total and difference.


**Conditional Statements**

--If Statements

**Syntax
	IF <condition> THEN
		PLSQL Statement
	END IF;

--If Else Statement
**Syntax

	IF<condition> THEN
		PLSQL statement
	ELSE
		PLSQL statement
	END IF;

-- If Else If Statement
**Syntax
	IF<condition> THEN
		PLSQL Statement
	ELSIF <condition 2> THEN
		PLSQL Statement
	END IF;

-- Case Statement - Multiple Conditions
Syntax:
CASE
   WHEN <condition1> THEN
        //PLSQL Statements
   WHEN <condition2> THEN
        //PLSQL Statements
   ELSE
        //PLSQL Statements
END CASE;

-- Case Statement - Possibilities of one expression/variable
Syntax:
CASE <expression/variable>
     WHEN <valuel> THEN
          //PLSQL Statements
     WHEN <valuel2> THEN
          //PLSQL Statements
     ELSE
         //PLSQL Statements
END CASE;

2. Create a PLSQL block to accept employee salary from the user
and display the tax amount and net salary using the 
following criteria.
if salary>500000.00, tax rate=0.15
if salary>300000.00, tax rate=0.10
if salary>100000.00, tax rate=0.08
else tax rate=0.00


**Loops in PLSQL**
--General Loop
Syntax:
LOOP
   //PLSQL Statements
   EXIT WHEN <condition>;

END LOOP;

--Create a PLSQL block to print numbers from 0 to 30
--Loop is terminated when condition is evaluated to be true
/*
--While Loop
Syntax:
     WHILW <condition> LOOP
        //PLSQL Statements
     END LOOP;
*/

--Cteate a PLSQL block to display only the numbers that can be divided by 3
--whithout any remainders which are between 10 and 50

/*
--For Loops
--1. Inctement Loop
Syntax:
FOR <variable> IN <lower_bount>..<upper_bound> LOOP
    //Statements
END LOOP;
*/

--Create a PLSQL block that displays numbers from 10 to 20 using a for loop

/*
Create the following table with their constraints 
 Table name : employees
 Colums:
 - id integer /number autoincrement primary key
 - e_index varchar should start with EID
 - e_name varchar
 - basic_salary decimal (20,2) defailt 25000.00
 - allowances decimal (20,2) default 0.00 should not be less than 0
 - deduction decimal (20,2) default 0.00 should not be less than 0
*/

/*
Insert at least 3 records into employees table. Use your own data

** Working with data stored in a table**

1) Select table

Select intatement are use to retreve data stored for a specific record or raw from a table and store them in plsql variables.
It can be use only only when select command retreve a single record.

 SYNTAX : 
		SELECT <column_list> INTO <variable_list> WHERE <conditions>;

To make sure that select into statement retreves only one record a where clouse should be use to filter out unnessesary records
Additionaly we can use limit clouse to restrict the number of records retreve to one

**PLSQL Cotext Area**

Context area is the memory region allocated by oracale for processing SQL statement and thair result.If stores information associanted with
the execution of SQL statements. The context area may consist of information such as
          1.Active Set
                  Rows returned when exexuting a select statement.
          2.Execution Details
                  Information related to the complied SQL statements.
                               EX- .Resource utilization
                                   .Execution Plan
                                   .Number of raws affected
          3.Cursor Details
                  Tracks whather a cursor is used to access context area.

A cursor is a pointer to a context area associated with a SQL statement. It is provide the accessibility to the information available on a context area.
Cursors are used to gain more control over the information and to access numberof raws affected, process data from quarry result raw at a time.
          1.Implicit Cursors
                    A set of predifined cursors executed autfomatically by oracel system when executing SQL ststements. 
An implicit cursor is wed only when there their is no explicat cursor associated. with the Gung.
          2.Explicit cursers
                    These cursors can be used to gain mare Carra Control over the These are developer defined 
Curves used for GPL/SQL block Context processing information Carry results) from Generally they are used with select Statements.

**Attributes of a cursor**

1.Row Count

Returns the number of raws affected by SQL statements.
Syntax: <cursur>% ROWCOUNT

EX- SQL % ROWCOUNT

2.Found
Returnd true if select into statement retrieve a row or a insert,update or delete statement affected atleast one row.
Syntax: <cursur>% FOUND

3.Not Found
Returnd true if a select into statement that cloes not retrieve any recotd or returns true if inset,update or delete commands did
not medify any record at all.
Syntax: <cursur>% NOTFOUND

**EXPLICIT CURSORS**
1) Declare the cursor

CURSOR Cuisar-name> IS <Select Statement >

2) Opening Cursor

OPEN Cursor-name>

3)

Fetch Data (used inside Loop)

FFTCH Cursor name> INTO <variable>

4) Close Cursor

CLOSE Cursor name>

**Stored Procedores**
  It is ate type of sub programs used to perfome a specific task using PLSQL statements.there are store in the databased as precompile objects . a procedores is a
named logical unit that can accept parameter execute SQL statement and return result.

 -Caractor is Procedores-
1.Pre Compiled Objects
    -It is are stored in the database after there copilaction it hels to reduce the execution type when it is involed.
2.Reduce Network traffic
    -Stored Procedure help inpliment bussines logic of an application in the database layer. As the oparactio are executed in the databased sarver the number of collection reqast
and network traffic between application and database is rediuced. 
3.Cord Reuserbility
    -SP can be used multiple times from deferent application or devices without rewriting SQL logic.
4.Security
    -Direct accessibility to store procedurs can be restricted using diffrent privilages for user role and users.

--Syntax
/*
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE <procedure_name>(<parameter list>)
AS
  //Variable declaration
BEGIN
  //PLSQL Statements
END;
*/

IN- These parameters are used to pass valius in to procedur thay are consider to be only 
the valius of the parameters can not be updated from the inside of the pocedure. it is defolte type of the parameter.

OUT- These parameter are used to pass valius from the store procedure .A variable that is not been inilized can be pass as and out parameters.
The valiue of out parameters can be change deuring procedure exicution. 

IN OUT- This parameters can be used pass valius in to a procedure and out from the procedure. There are read only and must been initialized before passing in to 
a procedure.

- Database Administation with Oracle-

Database administration refers to the activities involed with managing and maintaining a database system to ensure data consistency
availability by optimizing the performence and security 

Task involed with database administration 

01) Installing and configering the database 
02) Backup and recovery
                  Invloes scheduling regular database backup setup desaster recovery plan and restore options.

03) Performance Optimizing
	Using proper indexing and partitioning machanisms to improve query execution using pre complie database object and result cashing
	helps to improve the performance .

04) Data intergrity & Consistency
  	Using intergrity constrains by prymary keys foreign keys unique constraind domain constrains check constrains and
	not null constrains also involes using transactions triggers store procedure on validation data stored in databases.

05) Access controll

	Insuering security involes user roll management permition management and user account management 		


**Backup Types
01) Full backup
	Full backup copies the entire database including data database structure and required controll files 

02) Incremental backup
	Copies changes make to the database since last full backup can create incremental backup of two levels 
 level 0: Similler to the full backup
 level 1: Differencial or incremental

03) Archievelog backup

create a copy of the archivelog files in the oracle server it enables users to freeup the memmory space cosumed by archive files by
deleting them after creating the backup.



**NO AQL (Not Only SQL)**

nosql is a non relational database approach that allows storing unstructured or semi structured data 
no sql do not use any sql queries and avoid using sql joints. it provides a flexible approach to store data by allowing values of different data types to be stored for the same attribute
also it can store records representing the same entity with different sets of attributes 
no sql databases are used when it is required to handle large ammount of data with different attributes and not following any predefined formats
they are being used in real time application,social media platforms,IOT applications,content management systems and e-commerce applications

**Characteristics of NO SQL**

01.Non-Relational- No SQL never provide or use tables with fixed set of attributes.do not require any normalization or object relationale mapping (Foreighn Keys)
02.Schema Free- Can use value of different data types for the same attributes.do not follow domain constraints 
03.Simple API- Do not use any sql queries.a set of predefined methods to manage data and quering the results.do not use complex structures like SQL Joints.data is stored in the form of jeson or xml
04.Performance-No SQL is used for big data and reak time application.considered to be providing auto-scaling and failover capabilities.only supports eventual consistancy.
 
**Key-Value Stores**
-data is stored in key value pairs. usually represented as associative arrays. consisting of keys and values.each key is unique identifier and values are stored in the form of json
Examples-Redis,Amazon,DynamoDB
